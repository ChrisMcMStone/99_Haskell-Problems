--4) Find the number of elements in a list
--

myReverse3 :: [a] -> [a]

--6) Find out whether a list is a palindrome.
--

--7) Transform a list, possibly holding lists as elements into a `flat' list by replacing each list with its elements (recursively).
-- We have to define a new data type, because lists in Haskell are homogeneous.

--8) Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements (order of elimates should not change)

--9) Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists.

--10) Run-length encoding of a list. Use the result of Q9 to implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method.
--Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as lists (N, E) where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.
